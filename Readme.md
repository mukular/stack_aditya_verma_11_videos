# Types of problems using stack:-

1. Nearest Greater to left
2. Nearest Greater to right
3. Nearest Smaller to left
4. Nearest Smaller to right
5. Stock Span Problem
6. Maximum area of histogram
7. Maximum Area of Rectangle in Binary Matrix
8. Rain Water Trapping
9. Implementing a Min Stack
10. Implementing stack using heap
11. The celebrity Problem
12. Longest valid Parentheses
13. Iterative Tower Of Hanoi

## If there are two loops using in a solution with time complexity = O($n^2$) and it is seen that inner loop j variable is dependent on outer loop i variable, then stack concept may be used in it.
